# Subgroups

This document is a proposal to create subgroups of the guest languages SIG.
All subgroups will be viewed as a part of SIG-Guest-Languages and adhere to all of its rules.

For a subgroup to be formed, there must be two or more members supporting its creation who have agreed to become its co-chairs.
Co-chairs are responsible for scheduling and running, meetings and upholding the [Bytecode Alliance Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi/blob/main/ORG_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Only one kind of subgroup is proposed initially, but this may be extended by future proposals.

Subgroups and their co-chairs are listed in this document. Any proposed subgroups or changes to the co-chairs of a subgroup must be submitted as a PR to this repository, placed on the agenda for a SIG-Guest-Languages at least a week before its next meeting, and accepted by a vote.

## Language-Specific Subgroups

A language-specific subgroup will be focused on a single programming language ecosystem and
exist to further the Wasm support for that language.

The language-specific subgroups are

* Python - co-chairs:
  * Joel Dice (Fermyon)
  * Kevin Smith (SingleStore)
* JavaScript & TypeScript (JS/TS) - co-chairs:
